# Regex - Tutorial

> Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the `exec()` and `test()` methods of RegExp, and with the `match()`, `matchAll()`, `replace()`, `replaceAll()`, `search()`, and `split()` methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.
